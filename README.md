## SOLiD SLAM
* SOLiD can be integrated with any LiDAR type (e.g. spinning LiDAR or solid-state LiDAR) and any LiDAR Odometry algorithm. Also, lightweight characteristic can be improved Multi-Robot SLAM. 
	* Integrated with A-LOAM (TBD)
	* Integrated with Livox-LOAM (TBD)
	* Integrated with LIO-SAM (TBD)
	* Integrated with FAST-LIO2 (TBD)
	* Integrated with ICP odometry (TBD)
		* This code is for the purpose of study to determine the possibility.
	* Integrated with Multi-Robot ICP odometry (TBD)
